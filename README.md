<h1 align="center">Social Sync</h1>

<div>
  Social Sync is a platform developed as part of my Final Professional Aptitude Project (called PAP in Portugal).
</div>
<div>
  It is designed to help influencers manage interactions across social media more efficiently — including organizing messages, tracking engagement, and streamlining responses in one place. Although I couldn't use the socials APIs I still made a demo, and used part of Twitter (X) API.
  This was my first project using Next.js so it might be a little messed up but I tried my best.
