<h1 align="center">Social Sync</h1>

<div>
  Social Sync is a platform developed as part of my Final Professional Aptitude Project (called PAP in Portugal).
</div>
<div>
  It is designed to help influencers manage interactions across social media more efficiently â€” including organizing calendars, tracking engagement, scheduling posts, connecting socials, handling messages... in one place. Also it includes a translation system.
  <br>
  I think this has some value that's why I am publishing it, and I think it's a good app idea that can lead to a business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although I couldn't use the socials APIs (because they were paid ðŸ˜¡) I still made a demo using mock data, and used part of Twitter (X) API and Google Auth API.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was my first project using Next.js so it might be a little messed up but I tried my best.
